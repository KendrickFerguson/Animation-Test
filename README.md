# 3D Animation with GSAP, Three.js, and Framer Motion in Next.js

This repository demonstrates how to create a 3D animation using **GSAP** and **Three.js**, and implement animated routing using **Framer Motion** in a **Next.js** application.

# Objective

Create a 3D model of a cold drink can that can be rotated using mouse scroll. Additionally, when the cap of the cold drink is clicked, navigate to another static page with an animation.

## Features

- **3D model rendering with Three.js**
- **Smooth animations with GSAP**
- **Animated routing with Framer Motion in Next.js**
- **Interactive and dynamic user experience**

> **Note**: You can use any other 3D and animation library to achieve your desired result.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.
